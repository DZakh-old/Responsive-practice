# Responsive practice
Firstly it was a simple layout to practice responsive design with few media quires, but I created an adaptation for screens with any size. 
In the project, I used CSS flex and grid.
Plus I added few functions (that I also used in the [Pantheon project](https://github.com/DZakh/pantheon)): 
- Fix for correct 100vh display on mobile devices
- Smooth scroll through page anchors

And finally, I decided to learn bundlers in the project. I used Parcel-bundler and to make it useful I appended PostCSS with nanocss, autoprefix, and uncss.


*Thanks to one anonymous developer who enlightened me about the component approach in js, basics of spa, how to use json and ajax requests. But it was too overwhelming for the small page, so I'll apply this in a future project.*
