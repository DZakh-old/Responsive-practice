# Responsive practice
At first it was a simple layout to practice responsive design with few breakpoints, but I created adaptation for screens with any size. 
In the project I used css flex and grid.
Plus I added few functions (that I also used in [Pantheon project](https://github.com/DZakh/pantheon)): 
- Fix for correct 100vh display on mobile devices
- Smooth scroll through page anchors

And finally I decided to learn builders in the project. I used Parcel-bundler and to make it useful I appended post-css with nanocss, autoprefix and uncss.


*Thanks to one anonymous developer who enlightened me about component approach in js, basics of sap, how to use json and to do it with ajax. But it was too much for the page, so I'll apply this in a future project.*
